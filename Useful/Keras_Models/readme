Implementation of Classification Algorithm using Keras

- This time the Keras library allows us to implement the Classifier much easier with the help of the Sequential, Dense and Adam function
- increase amount of epochs to gain a higher accuracy score (model.fit...)
- plots loss and accuracy 
- Can predict the probability of a point being in a certain area
