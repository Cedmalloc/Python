Tensorflow
- Tensors : basic chunks of data = arrays of values 
- 2 Sections : 
- first :Building nodes
- second : running model

Build : 
Build nodes, with more than 0 Tensors
Decide on a model architecture, input and outputs, parameters
Split training and testing data

Running : 
Run session to output results
Specify Epochs (Under/Overfitting problem)
1st train then test
