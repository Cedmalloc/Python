This Project :
- classifies random points using the sigmoid function, estimating the error with Cross Entropy 
- iteratively finds the best line using Batch Gradient Descent weighted with a learning rate alpha
- batch Gradient descent limits the number of points we can effectively classify, stochastic needed
  for larger datasets
